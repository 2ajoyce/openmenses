## Phase 7: iOS Native Shell

Phase 7 builds a thin iOS native shell that hosts the Go engine as an in-process library (via `gomobile bind`) and renders the existing React UI in a WkWebView. The Go engine serves **both** the Connect-RPC API and the bundled UI static files from a single `http://127.0.0.1:<random_port>` listener, so the WebView loads everything from the same origin (avoiding CORS issues with `file://` URLs). HealthKit menstrual flow integration follows as a second sub-phase after the shell is working.

This phase spans Go, TypeScript, and Swift. It does **not** modify the proto schema, generated code, or existing engine internals. It adds a new Go package, edits one UI file, and creates a new Xcode project.

### Background / Key Decisions

- **gomobile bind** produces an `.xcframework` containing a native iOS binary of the Go engine. The native shell links it and calls exported Go functions directly — no subprocess, no FFI marshalling. See https://go.dev/wiki/Mobile#sdk-applications-and-generating-bindings.
- **gomobile restrictions**: Exported functions can only use primitives (`int`, `string`, `bool`, `error`, `[]byte`). No `context.Context`, `http.Handler`, interfaces, channels, or complex structs. The bridge package wraps the existing `engine.Engine` API into gomobile-safe functions.
- **Static file serving from Go**: The Go HTTP mux serves both the Connect-RPC handler (at its service path) and a static file server (at `/`) for the bundled `ui/dist/` output. A SPA fallback ensures client-side routes resolve to `index.html`.
- **Auth token**: A 32-byte random hex token is generated at engine startup and injected into the WebView via JavaScript (`window.__OPENMENSES_ENGINE__`). All Connect-RPC requests must include `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Static file requests are unauthenticated (they are the UI itself).
- **iOS 16+ minimum deployment target**: Provides modern WkWebView APIs, HealthKit improvements, and covers 95%+ of active devices.
- **UIKit, not SwiftUI**: WkWebView hosting is simpler and better documented in UIKit. No storyboards beyond LaunchScreen (programmatic layout).
- **No external Swift dependencies**: No CocoaPods, SPM packages, or Carthage for the MVP shell. HealthKit is a system framework.
- **Domain logic stays in Go**: Per `AGENT.md` and `PROJECT_PLAN.md`, the native shell contains zero domain logic. HealthKit integration (Phase 7D) reads/writes HealthKit data and funnels it through the Connect-RPC API.
- **iCloud backup is automatic**: All persistent data is in a SQLite file in the app's Documents directory. iOS backs this up to iCloud without any custom integration code.

## Sub-Phase 7A: Go Mobile Bindings ✓

`engine/mobile/bridge.go` and `engine/mobile/bridge_test.go` are complete. The bridge package implements `Start`/`Stop`/`Port`/`AuthToken`, auth middleware, and SPA static file serving. All tests pass. `make mobile-setup` and `make mobile-ios` verified working on macOS.

---

## Sub-Phase 7C: Xcode Project & iOS Shell

Steps 8–11 (Xcode project, EngineManager, WebViewController, AppDelegate/SceneDelegate) are complete. The iOS shell is built with xcodegen (`project.yml`), links `Engine.xcframework` as a static framework, copies UI assets via a post-build script, and injects engine config (`port`, `authToken`) into the WKWebView at document start. The bridge API uses separate `Port()`/`AuthToken()` getters (in `engine/mobile/bridge.go`) to avoid gomobile multi-return complexity. `.gitignore` covers `Engine.xcframework/` and `ui/`. All engine tests pass; `go vet` and `gofmt` are clean. `NSAppTransportSecurity` uses `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` (not `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads`).

- [X] Build and run on iOS Simulator — expect: app launches, WebView loads UI, can create/view observations

### Step 12: End-to-end verification

Manual verification checklist (no automated iOS tests for MVP):

- [X] `make ui-bundle` produces `ui/dist/` with production build
- [X] `make mobile-ios` produces `mobile/ios/Engine.xcframework/`
- [x] Xcode build succeeds with both artifacts linked
- [x] iOS Simulator: app launches → blank LaunchScreen → WebView loads Framework7 UI
- [x] Can create a user profile
- [x] Can log a bleeding observation
- [ ] Can view the timeline
- [x] Can navigate all tabs (Timeline, Cycles, Log, Medications, Settings)
- [ ] Can export data (JSON/CSV)
- [ ] Can view clinician summary
- [ ] App survives backgrounding and foregrounding
- [ ] App data persists across launches (SQLite in Documents)
- [ ] `make ci` still passes (no regressions from UI changes)

---

## Sub-Phase 7D: HealthKit Integration

Add bi-directional sync of menstrual flow data between the app and Apple HealthKit. All HealthKit code lives in the native Swift shell — **no domain logic in Swift**. The shell reads/writes HealthKit and translates to/from Connect-RPC calls to the engine.

### Step 13: HealthKit entitlement and permissions

Configure the Xcode project for HealthKit access.

- [ ] Add HealthKit capability to the Xcode project (Signing & Capabilities → + HealthKit)
- [ ] Add to `Info.plist`:
  - `NSHealthShareUsageDescription`: "OpenMenses reads menstrual flow data from Health to avoid duplicate logging."
  - `NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription`: "OpenMenses writes menstrual flow observations to Health so your cycle data is available across apps."
- [ ] Verify project still builds with HealthKit entitlement

### Step 14: HealthKitManager.swift

New singleton managing HealthKit operations. This class handles authorization, reading, and writing menstrual flow data.

**HealthKit data type**: `HKCategoryTypeIdentifierMenstrualFlow`

**Value mapping** between HealthKit `HKCategoryValueMenstrualFlow` and proto `BleedingFlow`:

| HealthKit Value | Proto `BleedingFlow`   |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| `.unspecified`  | skip (don't import)    |
| `.none`         | `BLEEDING_FLOW_NONE`   |
| `.light`        | `BLEEDING_FLOW_LIGHT`  |
| `.medium`       | `BLEEDING_FLOW_MEDIUM` |
| `.heavy`        | `BLEEDING_FLOW_HEAVY`  |

Reverse mapping (proto → HealthKit):

| Proto `BleedingFlow`        | HealthKit Value     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `BLEEDING_FLOW_UNSPECIFIED` | skip (don't export) |
| `BLEEDING_FLOW_NONE`        | `.none`             |
| `BLEEDING_FLOW_LIGHT`       | `.light`            |
| `BLEEDING_FLOW_MEDIUM`      | `.medium`           |
| `BLEEDING_FLOW_HEAVY`       | `.heavy`            |

**Key methods**:

```swift
import HealthKit

final class HealthKitManager {
    static let shared = HealthKitManager()
    private let healthStore = HKHealthStore()

    private let menstrualFlowType = HKCategoryType(.menstrualFlow)

    /// Request read/write authorization for menstrual flow.
    func requestAuthorization() async throws { ... }

    /// Query HealthKit for menstrual flow samples since the given date.
    /// Returns samples that can be converted to BleedingObservation RPCs.
    func fetchMenstrualFlow(since: Date) async throws -> [MenstrualFlowSample] { ... }

    /// Write a menstrual flow sample to HealthKit.
    func writeMenstrualFlow(date: Date, flow: Int, isStartOfCycle: Bool) async throws { ... }
}

struct MenstrualFlowSample {
    let startDate: Date
    let endDate: Date
    let flowLevel: Int  // maps to BleedingFlow enum value
    let isStartOfCycle: Bool
}
```

**Import flow** (HealthKit → Engine):

1. Query HealthKit for `HKCategoryTypeIdentifierMenstrualFlow` samples since last sync date
2. For each sample, map `HKCategoryValueMenstrualFlow` to `BleedingFlow` enum value
3. Call `CreateBleedingObservation` Connect-RPC endpoint for each observation
4. Engine-side validation will reject duplicates (by date) — this is expected and safe
5. Store last sync date in `UserDefaults`

**Export flow** (Engine → HealthKit):

1. When a new bleeding observation is created in the app, also write it to HealthKit
2. This is triggered from the native layer, not the UI — use a notification or polling approach
3. Set `HKMetadataKeyMenstrualCycleStart` on samples where the observation corresponds to the start of a new cycle

- [ ] Create `mobile/ios/OpenMenses/HealthKitManager.swift` with the structure above
- [ ] Implement `requestAuthorization()` — request read/write for menstrual flow
- [ ] Implement `fetchMenstrualFlow(since:)` — query HealthKit, map values
- [ ] Implement `writeMenstrualFlow(date:flow:isStartOfCycle:)` — write sample to HealthKit
- [ ] Test on physical device (HealthKit is not available in Simulator by default — use Health app on device)

### Step 15: Sync orchestration

Wire up the HealthKit sync triggers.

**On app launch** (in `AppDelegate.didFinishLaunchingWithOptions`, after engine starts):

1. Request HealthKit authorization (if not already granted)
2. Fetch menstrual flow samples since last sync
3. Import each into the engine via Connect-RPC

**On new bleeding observation** (requires native↔WebView communication):

1. WebView notifies native layer when a bleeding observation is created
2. Native layer reads the observation from the engine (or receives it via message)
3. Native layer writes it to HealthKit

**User settings toggle**:

1. Add a toggle in the Settings page: "Sync with Apple Health"
2. Store preference in `UserDefaults`
3. Only run sync when enabled

- [ ] Add post-launch sync logic to `AppDelegate` or `SceneDelegate`
- [ ] Store/read last sync date in `UserDefaults`
- [ ] Add HealthKit sync toggle to settings (requires WebView↔native message)
- [ ] Test import: add menstrual flow in Health app → launch OpenMenses → verify observation appears
- [ ] Test export: log bleeding in OpenMenses → verify it appears in Health app

### Step 16: WebView ↔ Native messaging for HealthKit

Add a message channel so the UI can trigger HealthKit operations and receive results.

**Native side** (in `WebViewController.swift`):

```swift
// Add WKScriptMessageHandler for "healthkit" messages
config.userContentController.add(self, name: "healthkit")

// Handle messages
func userContentController(_ controller: WKUserContentController,
                          didReceive message: WKScriptMessage) {
    guard let body = message.body as? [String: Any],
          let action = body["action"] as? String else { return }

    switch action {
    case "import":
        Task { await importFromHealthKit() }
    case "requestAuth":
        Task { await requestHealthKitAuth() }
    default:
        break
    }
}
```

**UI side** (new utility in `ui/src/lib/`):

```typescript
// Check if running in native iOS shell with HealthKit support
export function isHealthKitAvailable(): boolean {
  return (
    "webkit" in window &&
    "messageHandlers" in (window as any).webkit &&
    "healthkit" in (window as any).webkit.messageHandlers
  );
}

// Request HealthKit authorization
export function requestHealthKitAuth(): void {
  (window as any).webkit.messageHandlers.healthkit.postMessage({
    action: "requestAuth",
  });
}

// Trigger HealthKit import
export function importFromHealthKit(): void {
  (window as any).webkit.messageHandlers.healthkit.postMessage({
    action: "import",
  });
}
```

- [ ] Add `WKScriptMessageHandler` to `WebViewController` for "healthkit" messages
- [ ] Create `ui/src/lib/healthkit.ts` with native messaging helpers
- [ ] Add "Import from Health" button to Settings page (visible only when `isHealthKitAvailable()`)
- [ ] Run `make ui-lint` — must pass
- [ ] Run `make ui-test` — must pass
- [ ] Test on physical device: tap "Import from Health" → HealthKit permission prompt → data imported

## Implementation Order

```
7A: Step 1 (bridge.go) → Step 2 (auth middleware) → Step 3 (SPA file server) → Step 4 (tests) → Step 5 (Makefile)
7B: Step 6 (global.d.ts) → Step 7 (client.ts changes) — can run PARALLEL with 7A
7C: Step 8 (Xcode project) → Step 9 (EngineManager) → Step 10 (WebViewController) → Step 11 (AppDelegate) → Step 12 (e2e verification) — depends on 7A + 7B
7D: Step 13 (entitlement) → Step 14 (HealthKitManager) → Step 15 (sync) → Step 16 (WebView messaging) — depends on 7C
```

Sub-phases 7A and 7B are fully independent and can be worked on in parallel.
Sub-phase 7C requires 7A (xcframework) and 7B (UI supports dynamic URL).
Sub-phase 7D requires 7C (working iOS shell).

## Key Reusable Code

- `engine/pkg/openmenses/engine.go` — `NewEngine()`, `Handler()`, `Close()` — the bridge wraps these
- `engine/cmd/engine-dev/main.go` — reference HTTP server setup, CORS middleware pattern
- `ui/src/lib/client.ts` — Connect-RPC client, modified in Step 7 for dynamic URL/auth
- `gen/go/openmenses/v1/openmensesv1connect/` — Connect-RPC generated handler/client code (used by bridge for path prefix)
- `ui/dist/` — Vite production build output, served by Go static file server

## Out of Scope (future phases)

- **Android shell** (Phase 8) — Kotlin + WebView + Google Fit, mirrors iOS architecture
- **Local notifications** — period/PMS reminders via UNUserNotificationCenter
- **App Store submission** — provisioning, signing, metadata, review
- **TestFlight distribution** — beta testing pipeline
- **Automated iOS tests** (XCTest) — manual verification for MVP
- **CI for iOS builds** — requires macOS runner (GitHub Actions or similar)
- **Background App Refresh** — periodic HealthKit sync when app is backgrounded
- **Siri Shortcuts / Widgets** — quick logging from home screen
